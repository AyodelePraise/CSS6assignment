            <ul>
                <li><strong>1914</strong> - Born in Cresco, lowa</li>
                <li><b>1933</b> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
                    thanks to a Depression ere program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li>
                <li><b>1935</b> - Has to stop School and save up more money. works in the civillian conversation
                     corps, helping starving Americans. 'I saw how food changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me".</li>
                <li><b>1937</b> - Finishes University and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li><b>1938</b> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin
                     Charles Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest- resistent plants</li>
                <li><b>1941</b> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and plant Pathology</li>
                <li><b>1944</b>- Rejects a 100% salary from Dupont, leaves behind
                     his pregnant wife and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16years,
                      his team breeds 6,000 different strains of diseases resistent wheat - including different varieties
                      for each major climate on Earth</li>
                <li><b>1945</b> - Discoveres a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
                <li><b>1953</b> - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yielding American
                     breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
                <li><b>1962</b> - Visits Delhi and brings of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expaanding population</li>
                <li><b>1970</b> - Receives the Nobel Peace Price</li>
                <li><b>1983</b> - Helps seven African Countries dramatically increase their maize and sorghum yields</li>

                <li><b>2005</b> - States "We will have to double the World food supply by 2050." Argues that genetically 
                    modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of arable land.
                    Says tha GM crops are not inherently dangerous because "We've been genetically modifying plants and animals for 
                    a long time. Long before we called it Science, people were selecting the best breeds".</li>
                <li><b>2009</b> - Dies at the age of 95</li>
